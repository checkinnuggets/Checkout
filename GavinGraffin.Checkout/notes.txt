Hour is almost up.  Current thoughts:

- When scanning item, thinking about getting the prices/special offers at that point.
	- this would allow me to check sku is valid as we go, rather than at the end. 
	- would also be useful in keeping a running total/having a set of billing lines

- Thinking about whether Special Offer is really a 'thing', or if it's more kind of 'Pricing Levels' with 
  standard being the price at 1 rather than 'standard'  and 'special' prices.

- Current assumption is that only one special offer per sku.  

- There may also be more complex types of special offer e.g. "Buy X, get Y half price".
	- That goes in a different direction to 'Pricing  Levels' so would think about that
